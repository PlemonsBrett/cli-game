# Who wants to be a Computer Science Millionaire?

This is a cli based game I created to help a friend practice concepts while learning computer science. I am working to make it more extensible, but for now it only covers data structures!

If you are on a *nix based system you can simply run `npx @voltage_code/cli_game` to try it out. For windows users, you might have to just clone this repo, run `npm install` and then `node .` 

Feedback is welcome, in the form of issues/PRs!
